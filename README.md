# mtgIndex
Magic the Gathering card indexing tool


A list in no good order yet:

1. Download Database:
    - Scryfall's database seems like the most likely candidtate.
        -> its updated daily and is a larger database. downloading and updating should be an automated task.
    - Database comes as a CSV file, do we want to pump that CSV into a local DB? I would think so.
        -> does scryfall's csv download come with a changelog? 0(n) when n is over 100k seems silly.


2. detect the overall card:
    - find rectangle shape.
    - Do I need to know which side is up?
    - read name of card
    - read set designator and card number

3.
